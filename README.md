# Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge

### Challenge Background
  To illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates. For this challenge I made an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then add the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, I added a third map style. All map styles were added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.
  
### Challenge Objectives

- Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.

- Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.

- Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.

- Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.

#### Summary
  A map was created with three total layers: streets, satellite, and light map. Techtonic plates and earthquake overlays were added with earthquake magnitude defined by color according to a legend on the bottom right corner of the map.
